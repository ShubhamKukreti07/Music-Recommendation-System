# Music-Recommendation-System
Developed a music recommendation system leveraging a similarity matrix and TF-IDF vectorization to suggest songs based on user preferences. Implemented the backend logic for processing and analyzing song data, and built an intuitive web application using Streamlit to deliver personalized recommendations. The system effectively matches songs with similar lyrical content and genre characteristics, enhancing the user experience by providing relevant music choices.
